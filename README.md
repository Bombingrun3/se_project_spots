## Future Goals

Below is a list of SPOTS `FUTURE` implementations.

### 1. Video Posts

Right now SPOTS does not support video, but future iterations hope to implement that feature.

### 2. Friends **SPOTS**light

Currently, you can only view your own profile and content, but in future iterations, we will add a feature to search and favorite your friend's posts.

### 3. Sharing is Caring

We would also like to implement a feature of being able to share content from Spots directly to your other Social Media accounts.

### 4. Put a Pin in it!

Users will be able to pin the location of where the photo was taken so that other adventurers can make their own memories there as well.
